The directory structure of the test catalog looks like the following, where the catalog.json files under the landsat-8-l1 and sentinel-2-l1c are `Collections`, the rest of the catalog.json files are simple `Catalogs`, and the item.json files are `Items`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main STAC classes: Catalog, Collection, and Item, can be be opened directly from JSON files or they can created from JSON-serializable dictionaries. Opening from a file has the advantage of automatically being able to link to other STAC files, such as a collection or a parent catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python classes correspond to the different STAC constructs, with some additional classes due to implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thing**: A Thing is not a STAC object, it is a low-level parent class that is used by Catalog, Collection, and Item and includes the attributes they all have in common (read and save JSON, get links).\n",
    "- **Catalog**: A catalog is the simplest STAC object, containing an id, a description, the STAC version, and a list of links.\n",
    "- **Collection**: A Collection is a STAC catalog with some additional fields that describe a group of data, such as the provider, license, along with temporal and spatial extent.\n",
    "- **Item**: The Item class implements the STAC Item, and has several convenience functions such as retrieving the collection, getting assets by common band name (if using the EO Extension)\n",
    "- **Items**: The Items class does not correspond to a STAC object. It is a FeatureCollection of `Item`s, possibly from multiple collections. It is used to save and load sets of `Item`s as a FeatureCollection file, along with convenicen functions for extracting info across the set."
